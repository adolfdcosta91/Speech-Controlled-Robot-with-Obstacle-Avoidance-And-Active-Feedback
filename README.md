# Speech Controlled Robot With Obstacle Avoidance And Active Feedback

A robot that responds to speech commands from the user. The device provides an audio acknowledgment to every command it receives and then executes it. It has two ultrasonic sensors that help avoid obstacles. Two motor drivers that are connected in an H bridge pattern to run four independent high torque motors. One Sheeld is connected over the Arduino, which is a bridge between the mobile and Arduino; it captures the input voice signal and feeds it to the Arduino via Low Energy Bluetooth. The robot contains one mono audio amplifier that amplifies the output signal from Arduino and plays it on 8 Ohms speaker.
